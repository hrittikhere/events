## Use Azure as your personal computer ft. VSCode: August 29th, 1PM IST

[Registeration Link](https://forms.office.com/r/VGJwE5BYqd)

A hands-on session where you would experience creating a virtual machine from scratch. Now, we would start by clearing your basics about cloud computing first. So, no prerequisites to attend this session.

As the prerequisites are clear we would go on to create a Linux VM on Azure with help of asymmetric encryption and then connect it with the loved VSCode. By the end, you would be able to run your workloads directly on Azure :)

Why would you like to run workloads on Linux?
Linux is way better than Windows. Most of the DevOps tools support only Linux. Last but not the least, 90 % of servers are Linux :)

Join us in this power Bootcamp ðŸ™Œ

Before you ask we would be providing certificates and digital swags to all those who can deploy the VM. Join the Chat on [LinkedIN](https://www.linkedin.com/events/6824242363796471808/about/) or [Telegram](https://t.me/joinchat/FjVuSFMYZNBkMTM9) 

More details and Instructions would be added here:
