## The path to a Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador: April 25th, 1PM IST


"The Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors is a program to sponsor students majoring in disciplines related to technology. The MLSA program enhances students' employability by offering training in skills not usually taught in academia, including knowledge of Microsoft technologies." - Wikipedia

In this seminar, we would explore the path of you becoming an MLSA and what helped me to get into the programme in my first year of University. I would focus on the benefits, application process and how MLSA is helping me to build my career.

MLSA offers student from diverse background so to get accepted to the program or attend this seminar you don't need to pursue CSE or anything computer engineering related. You have a chance if you have the passion to help the community grow.

And please fill the form and also join at least one instant messaging or LinkedIn event chat so that we can keep you updated with activities leading to the event.
